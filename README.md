# Inleiding-Programmeren

This was my very first time getting deeply into JavaScript and trying to make something that actually worked. I picked a silly idea for the class, one I knew I could have fun with and be creative with - all the while learning the depths of JavaScript and the different ways I could achieve what I wanted. Visually, it's not much, and it wasn't meant to be - but it worked, and I learnt a lot from it. 
This is your Pokégachi: Budew! Although, he doesn't know that himself. You have to give him a name. One of your liking, or his actual one - the Pokémon will give you different answers depending which one, but it's up to you, he doesn't care. All he wants you to do is play dress up with him, and the more you do, the more his happiness meter fills up! If you fight him, it goes down.. so be careful.

I had a lot of fun messing learning this way, and although it may not look like much it was incredibly educational. For a first time, I truly believe this kicked me off to a great start.

Have fun with Budew! Or, erm, whatever you choose to call him. Not like he knows better..
